# Real-Time Weather App Concept

## Overview
The Real-Time Weather App is designed to provide users with up-to-date weather information for any city in the world. The app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays current weather conditions, a 5-day forecast, air quality index, and other weather-related metrics.

> **Note**: This app was developed following a YouTube tutorial, with some modifications to suit specific requirements and preferences.

## Features
1. **Current Weather**: Displays the current temperature, weather description, and weather icon.
2. **5-Day Forecast**: Provides a 5-day weather forecast with daily temperatures and weather icons.
3. **Air Quality Index (AQI)**: Shows the air quality index and detailed information about various pollutants.
4. **Sunrise and Sunset Times**: Displays the times for sunrise and sunset.
5. **Additional Metrics**: Includes humidity, pressure, visibility, wind speed, and "feels like" temperature.
6. **Hourly Forecast**: Provides an hourly weather forecast for the next 8 hours.
7. **Location Search**: Allows users to search for weather information by city name.
8. **Current Location**: Fetches weather information based on the user's current location using geolocation.

## User Interface
- **Header**: Contains the app title, search input for city names, and buttons for searching and fetching the current location.
- **Weather Data Section**: Divided into two main parts:
  - **Left Panel**: Displays current weather and 5-day forecast.
  - **Right Panel**: Shows today's highlights, including AQI, sunrise and sunset times, and additional metrics.
- **Hourly Forecast**: Displayed below the highlights section, showing the weather for the next 8 hours.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the app and making it responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For fetching data from the API and updating the DOM.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: For fetching weather data.
- **Moment.js**: For handling date and time formatting.
